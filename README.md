# 📚 Sentiment Analysis with NLP: Snow White Case Study

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to perform **sentiment analysis** on the classic fairytale _Snow White_. Using tokenization, lemmatization, vectorization, and Naive Bayes classification, I build a pipeline to classify text sentiment and evaluate model performance.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Perform text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
- Vectorize text using TF and TF-IDF techniques
- Build a **Naive Bayes classifier** to predict sentiment
- Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) format
- Matplotlib for visualization

## 🧠 Sample Results

| Metric         | Value                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy       | 85–95% (varied)                                                 |
| Top features   | "poison", "queen", "happy", "dead", etc.                        |
| Common classes | Positive / Negative labels (manually constructed or imbalanced) |
